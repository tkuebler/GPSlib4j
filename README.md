# GPSlib4j

This project started because Garmin didn't make a version of their software for Mac and I got tired of running windows in vmware just to get my run data out of my Forerunner.   Once I got it working for my mac and Forerunner I stopped development, but several other contributers joined in and help to support other units and SVG maps of runs, etc.  The project has been on haitus for a while, bringing it back with the intent to modernize it now that i/o support for java is more mature.

This project was [previously hosted on SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/gpslib4j/).
